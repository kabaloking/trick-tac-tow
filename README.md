# trick-tac-tow
this is a game that i made with pygame, it is very bad and a waste of time

requierments - 
python installed,
pygame installed
(install on terminal by: pip install pygame)

to run the game, make sure the assets are in the same directory as py script,
then click twice on the python file and exicute or exicute on cmd


you are an x in a tic tac tow board and you need to avoid the red blocks before they get big enugh to eat you. 
use the arrow keys to move around

warning:
this is a shitty game
